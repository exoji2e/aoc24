# Advent of Code 2024

My solutions to [advent of code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

If you wish to run them yourself:

install deps with `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Download your session cookie (from dev tools - storage/application) and create a file secret.py with the contents:
`session = '<your session cookie>'`.

Run each solution as a normal python file: `python3 solved/01/day01.py`.
